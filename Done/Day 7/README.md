# 🚀 FAANG Preparation – Day 7

Welcome to Day 7 of my 50-day FAANG Preparation Roadmap!  
Today, I focused on mastering one of the most critical stages in the machine learning lifecycle: **Feature Engineering & Pipelines**, while also reinforcing my foundations in **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** and **SQL** through practical exercises and mock interviews.

## 📌 Machine Learning: Feature Engineering & Pipelines

### ✅ What I Learned:
- The importance of feature scaling, encoding, and interaction features
- How pipelines simplify preprocessing and modeling workflows
- How to apply end-to-end pipelines using `scikit-learn` and deep learning frameworks

### 📂 Dataset Used:
**Cassava Leaf Disease Classification** (Kaggle)  
> Focus: Image classification with preprocessing pipelines and CNNs.

### 🔧 Techniques Applied:
- Image preprocessing pipeline using `tf.keras.preprocessing`
- Data Augmentation (rotation, zoom, flip)
- CNN model training using TensorFlow/Keras
- Evaluation & metrics reporting

## 🧠 DSA: Weekly Recap + Mock Interview

### 🔄 Topics Reviewed:
- Arrays: Two Sum, Max Consecutive Ones
- Hashing: Group Anagrams
- Sliding Window: Longest Substring Without Repeating
- Prefix Sums: Range Sum Queries
- String Manipulation: Valid Palindrome, Reverse String

### 📝 Mock Interview Q&A:
1. **What’s the difference between brute force and HashMap in Two Sum?**
2. **How do you clean strings in Valid Palindrome?**
3. **Why use prefix sum over repeated sum()?**

📁 All solutions are organized by day inside the `dsa-prep` GitHub folder.

## 🧮 SQL: Practice Day + Quiz

### 🔄 Topics Reviewed:
- `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `DISTINCT`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`
- Filtering, Aggregation, and Window Logic

### 📋 Mock Quiz Questions:
1. Retrieve customers with more than $100 total spend.
2. List top 5 cities by user count.
3. Compute average age of users per country.

💡 SQL code and screenshots saved in the `sql-practice` folder.

## 💼 LinkedIn Post of the Day

> 🔍 **Why SQL is a Must for Every Data Scientist in 2025**
> 
> I reflected on the role SQL plays in every real-world Data Science project.  
> 📊 It’s the first tool I reach for before touching Python or ML libraries.
