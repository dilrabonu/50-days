📅 Day 1 – FAANG 50-Day Challenge
✅ Topics Covered
Advanced Regression Techniques

Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)

Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)

ElasticNet Regression (Combination of L1 & L2)

Time & Space Complexity

Analyzed code efficiency using Big-O notation

Practiced estimating both runtime and memory usage

SQL Fundamentals

SELECT, FROM, WHERE statements

Filtering data using logical conditions (AND, OR)

🧠 Key Takeaways
🔹 Advanced Regression
Ridge: Shrinks coefficients but keeps all features → good for multicollinearity.

Lasso: Shrinks and removes unimportant features → ideal for feature selection.

ElasticNet: Combines both for balanced regularization.

🔹 Time & Space Complexity
Understood how to analyze algorithms using Big-O.

Practiced on LeetCode problems like Two Sum and Best Time to Buy/Sell Stock.

Learned how to optimize for both time and memory in code.

🔹 SQL Practice
Mastered the basics of querying data.

Used SELECT to retrieve specific columns.

Applied WHERE to filter rows based on conditions.

📍 Platforms Used
✅ Kaggle (for ML projects)

✅ LeetCode (for DSA & SQL)

✅ W3Schools & Mode Analytics (for SQL fundamentals)

🔜 Next Steps
Begin implementation of Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet regression on the Boston Housing Dataset using Scikit-Learn.

Compare model performance and visualize results.
