# 📅 Day 20 – FAANG Prep: CNNs, Heap & Stack, and SQL Trend Analysis

Welcome to **Day 20** of my 50-day FAANG Preparation Marathon!  
Today’s focus is on mastering **CNNs for image classification**, solving **interview-style problems using Heap and Stack**, and learning **SQL trend analysis with window functions** like `LAG`, `LEAD`, `FIRST_VALUE`, and `LAST_VALUE`.

## 🚀 Topics Covered

### 🧠 1. Machine Learning – CNNs for Image Classification
- Built and trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**.
- Learned about convolution, ReLU, pooling, and dense layers.
- Used **TensorFlow/Keras** for model creation, training, and evaluation.
- Applied concepts to **wildfire image detection** (bonus task for real-world application).

📁 Files:
- `cnn_cifar10_tensorflow.ipynb`: CNN on CIFAR-10
- `cnn_wildfire_custom.ipynb`: CNN applied to wildfire detection

### ✅ Key Learnings:
- CNN filters help extract patterns like edges and shapes.
- Pooling layers reduce image size and preserve features.
- Final dense layers classify based on learned features.

### 💡 2. DSA – Heap & Stack (Amazon/Google-style)
- Implemented **Min Stack** to track minimum element in constant time.
- Solved **Top-K Frequent Elements** using Max Heap.
- Tackled FAANG-style questions with Python and dry-run debugging.

📁 Files:
- `min_stack.py`
- `top_k_frequent.py`

✅ Key Learnings:
- Stack = LIFO (used for undo, browser back)
- Heap = Priority queue (used in top-K, median, scheduling)

---

### 📊 3. SQL – Trend Analysis using Window Functions
Used `LAG`, `LEAD`, `FIRST_VALUE`, and `LAST_VALUE` to compare trends across time in SQL.

📁 Files:
- `sql_trend_analysis.sql`
- Sample dataset: `stock_prices.csv`

✅ Key Learnings:
- `LAG()` helps compare current row to previous.
- `LEAD()` helps forecast future changes.
- `FIRST_VALUE()` and `LAST_VALUE()` useful for benchmarks.

Example Use Case: Detecting stock price changes and sales trends over time.

## 🧠 What I Learned Today
> CNNs taught me how machines "see" patterns.  
> Stacks and heaps showed how to build efficient systems.  
> SQL window functions made me analyze like a data scientist.
