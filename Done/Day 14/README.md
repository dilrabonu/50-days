## 📌 1. Machine Learning – Mock ML System Design (Computer Vision + Inference Pipeline)

### 🎯 Problem
Design a production-grade **image classification system** to detect plant diseases from leaf images.

### 🧱 Architecture Components
1. **Data Ingestion**: Images uploaded from mobile/web, stored in cloud (e.g., AWS S3)
2. **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Resize, normalize, augment
3. **Training**:
   - Model: CNN (EfficientNet / ResNet)
   - Framework: TensorFlow or PyTorch
   - Tracking: MLFlow / Weights & Biases
4. **Model Registry**: Save best models with version control
5. **Inference Pipeline**:
   - Model served via REST API (FastAPI or Flask)
   - Real-time prediction or batch inference
6. **Monitoring**: Track drift, performance, and feedback loop

### ✅ Outcome
Built a scalable pipeline that simulates real-world deployment, considering latency, versioning, and retraining strategy.

## 🧠 2. Data Structures & Algorithms – Sorting Algorithms

### 🎯 Topics Covered
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- TimSort (used in Python)

### 🧪 Mock Interview Practice
```python
arr = [(1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 5)]
sorted_arr = sorted(arr, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
