# 🚀 Day 18 – FAANG Preparation: Neural Networks, Priority Queues & CTEs

Welcome to **Day 18** of my [50-Day FAANG Preparation Roadmap](https://github.com/dilrabo-ai/50-days-faang-roadmap), where I dive deep into foundational concepts critical for Data Scientist & ML Engineer interviews. Today’s focus includes:

- 🧠 Neural Network Basics (MLP) – Implemented from scratch with NumPy  
- 🔢 Data Structures – Priority Queue, Heap, Median Finder  
- 📊 SQL – CTEs (WITH clause), Recursive and Modular Queries  

---

## 📘 1. Neural Network Basics – MLP from Scratch

**Goal**: Understand the core logic of forward and backpropagation in Multilayer Perceptrons.

### ✅ Topics Covered:
- Architecture: Input → Hidden → Output layers  
- Activation functions: Sigmoid  
- Forward Propagation  
- Backward Propagation  
- Weight Updates

### 📂 File:
- `mlp_numpy_from_scratch.py`  
(Contains full NumPy-based MLP implementation)

### 📊 Real-World Use:
- Predicting student performance  
- Digit classification  
- Fraud detection

---

## 🔢 2. Data Structures – Priority Queue & Heap

**Goal**: Master min-heaps, max-heaps, and how to solve top FAANG problems using heaps.

### ✅ Problems Solved:
- Top K Frequent Elements  
- Find Median from Data Stream

### 📂 Files:
- `priority_queue_topk.py`  
- `median_finder_heap.py`

### 🛠 Real-World Use:
- Live dashboards (e.g., YouTube view count)
- Scheduling systems
- Memory-efficient stream processing

---

## 📊 3. SQL – CTEs (WITH Clause)

**Goal**: Use CTEs and Recursive CTEs for clean, modular SQL queries.

### ✅ Concepts Implemented:
- Standard CTE for sales filtering  
- Recursive CTE for factorial calculation  
- Hierarchical traversal simulation

### 📂 File:
- `cte_queries.sql`

### 🌍 Real-World Use:
- Reporting & BI dashboards  
- Organizational chart processing  
- Tree structure flattening in databases



## 📌 Summary

Today's challenge strengthened my understanding of:
- Core neural network mechanics with hands-on NumPy coding  
- Real-world priority queue applications using heaps  
- Clean, modular SQL design using CTEs and recursion

This knowledge forms the base of many real-world AI systems and is frequently tested in FAANG-level interviews.
